# philosopher

**philosophers** is a project from the **42** Common Core, The project aims to create your first simulation project, using pthread and mutex. You have to simulate philosophers around a table who can be in 3 different states : "is eating", "is sleeping", "is thinking". Using times given in parameters you have to simulate the table and check if a philosopher must die or not.

### Usage

	~/philo$> make
	~/philo$> ./philo 5 800 200 200 
## bonus

The bonus part is a similar version of the mandatory part, but instead of using pthread and mutex, you have to use fork and semaphore (pthread are already allow).

### Usage

	~/philo_bonus$> make
	~/philo_bonus$> ./philo_bonus 5 800 200 200
